branding ideas
- title: "softmax"
- subtitle: "a cozy hacker home in sf where good people build great things"
- frens (the softmaxxers): show picture + main orgs (company, university, lab, etc), hobbies, links
- the house (ghiblified diagram, game exclamation marks and on hover show details of the house like rooms, console, tv, balcony/yard, books, games, hardware, etc)
- principles (be kind, do great work, spend time with friends, low ego)
- join us (embedded notion form)
- vibes (photos/art of meals, whiteboards, hiking, views, trips, etc)
- house calendar (luma with group meals, brunches, picnics, trips, karaoke, movie nights, etc)
- aesthetic to use is like pastel matcha, soft lavender, warm cream, sky blue, etc. basically studio ghibli.
- typography: one friendly rounded sans and one playful handwritten (but still very readable) accent
- graphics style like studio ghibli
